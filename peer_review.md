# Peer Review: Heart Disease Classification Analysis

**Project:** Machine Learning Classification Analysis  
**Author:**  
**Reviewer:** Branton Dawson  
**Review Date:** November 11, 2025  

Peer Review (Required)

Review one other GitHub repository and provide feedback on:

    Clarity & Organization (Is the notebook structured and easy to follow?)
    Feature Selection & Justification (Do the chosen features make sense given the objectives?)
    Model Performance & Comparisons (Are the results and comparisons clearly explained?)
    Reflection Quality (Are insights well thought out?)

Submission: Submit a short peer review document in your own repository titled peer_review.md.
The peer review must contain a clickable Markdown link to the notebook (.ipynb) file reviewed along with your personal, well-organized and presented 4-pont review. Provide specifics - both positive and constructive feedback. Suggest improvements where possible and explain why a different choice might be useful as well. Focus on actionable suggestions that the author could realistically implement.
4-point Repository Checklist

Verify your repository contains:

[ ] Jupyter Notebook with proper name, numbered sections and reflections.
[ ] README.md (see above) [ ] Dataset, stored in a data folder.
[ ] Peer Review (peer_review.md).
